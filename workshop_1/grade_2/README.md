Our final result is in boatclub_grade_2_after_reviews.pdf


#####Regarding the review from Adam Ã–sterlund, Kevin Amilund, Jonas Tornfors#####
It was a very well written review but we didn't find it useful at all.
We were extremly confused about what they said and found
it hard to belive that we have actually attended the same class and
read the same book.



The other peer review we found quite helpful, we realized that our model
may have been a bit software oriented. We have corrected at least one thing,
the authentication process is gone since it may not belong in the domain model. 
We still have our MemberRegister left though since the BoatClub needs to
be able to keep track of their members.
