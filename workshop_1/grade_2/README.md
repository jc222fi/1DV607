Our final result is in:
>boatclub_grade_2_after_reviews.pdf


#####Regarding the review from Adam Österlund, Kevin Amilund, Jonas Tornfors#####
It was a very well written review but we didn't find it useful at all.
We were extremly confused about what they said and found
it hard to belive that we have actually attended the same class and
read the same book.


#####Regarding the review from Mattias Wikström, Anna Iosif, Jasmin Bejtovic#####
This peer review we found quite helpful, we realized that our model
may have been a bit software oriented. We have corrected at least one thing,
the authentication process is gone since it may not belong in the domain model. 
We still have our MemberRegister left though since the BoatClub needs to
be able to keep track of their members.
Also the "User" class is gone, and "Secretary" is now a specialization of "Member".

However, about the payment, our understanding of the requirements for
grade 2 was that there should be nothing related to payments in 
the model, that was a part of the task for grade 3. So we are uncertain
if we are wrong or if they are wrong. We left it as it was.
